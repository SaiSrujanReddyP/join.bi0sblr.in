### GDB: The GNU Debugger

GDB is a powerful tool for debugging and analyzing programs. It allows you to step through code, examine memory, and inspect registers. Mastering GDB is crucial for reverse engineering, understanding program flow, and identifying vulnerabilities.

### Assembly Language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that directly corresponds to machine code instructions. Understanding assembly is crucial for binary exploitation, as vulnerabilities are often more apparent at this level.

### pwndbg: A GDB Enhancement

pwndbg is a plugin for GDB that provides additional features specifically tailored for exploit development, such as enhanced memory views, context-sensitive information, and convenience commands for analyzing binaries.

#### Theory

<summary>Hands-On Exercise</summary>

> > **Install GDB and pwndbg:** Install GDB and the pwndbg plugin on your system. This setup will be used throughout your binary exploitation journey.
> > **Debug a simple program:** Use GDB to step through a simple C program and examine its assembly code. Practice setting breakpoints, stepping through instructions, and examining register values.
> > **Disassemble Functions:** Use GDB to disassemble functions in a binary and analyze their assembly instructions. Identify function prologues, epilogues, and control flow.
