In our upcoming recruitment process, participants will first be required to complete a series of tasks listed on this website before the official CTF event. These tasks are an integral part of the process, as they provide an opportunity for participants to demonstrate their skills and earn bonus points. These bonus points will be considered during the interview stage, offering a significant advantage to those who perform well.

Once participants have completed the pre-CTF tasks, they will proceed to the official recruitment CTF. This CTF is designed to challenge and evaluate the participants' problem-solving abilities, technical knowledge, and adaptability under pressure. The results of this CTF, combined with the bonuses earned from the pre-CTF tasks, will be crucial in determining their suitability for recruitment.

During the interviews, candidates will be assessed not only on their performance in the CTF but also on the effort and results they achieved during the pre-CTF phase. The bonuses earned from the pre-CTF tasks will be added to their interview scores, potentially boosting their chances of being selected.

In summary, the recruitment process will be a comprehensive evaluation of both the CTF performance and the preparatory work completed beforehand. Candidates who show initiative and excel in the pre-CTF tasks will have an edge, reflecting their readiness and commitment to the challenges ahead.
